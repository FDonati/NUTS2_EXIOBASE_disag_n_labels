# NUTS2_EXIOBASE_labels

This repository contains script to merge regional labels for NUTS2 and EXIOBASE and products. 
It generates the fundamental labels to be used in RAMA-SCENE, CIRCUMAT and Hyb projects

The work was mostly developed by Sidney Niccolson. This is an adaptation from his work that was first integrated directly into the webapplications. 

I am now separating from the original web application to clarify structure and allow to repurpose it for other applications more easily.
