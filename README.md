# NUTS2_EXIOBASE

This repository contains script to retrieve a diverse set of data to disaggreagate Exiobase at the NUTS2 level. 
It also merges regional labels for NUTS2 and EXIOBASE and products, gnerates the tree-labels to be used in RAMA-SCENE, CIRCUMAT and Hyb projects

The work was mostly developed by Sidney Niccolson. This is an adaptation from his work that was first integrated directly into the webapplications. 

I am now separating from the original web application to clarify structure and allow to repurpose it for other applications more easily. 

# create_hierarchy_country.py
Prepare a CSV for hierarchical tree structures related to NUTS2 for CircuMat
